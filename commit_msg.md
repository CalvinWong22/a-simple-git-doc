1. Use present tense.
2. Begins with a verb.Just omit the subject because it is always “I”,the  developer.
3. Usethefirstlineassummary.
4. For a long message, use the text editor instead of the one line option -m . For a long message, add two line breaks and write the detail after the first summary line.
